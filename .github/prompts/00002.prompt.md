description: I want to build a Ruby on Rails development environment using Docker Compose.
---

I want to set up a Ruby on Rails development environment that runs with Docker Compose.
Prepare `compose.yml` and `rails/Dockerfile`. Mount the project's root directory into the container so code changes on the host are reflected inside the container.
Use a named volume for `vendor/bundle` so the bundle directory is independent from the host.
Use the latest stable `ruby` image as the base.
