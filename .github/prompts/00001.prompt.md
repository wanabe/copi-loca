description: I want to build an SSL-enabled web server environment using Caddy with Docker Compose.
---

I want to set up an SSL-enabled web server environment using Caddy with Docker Compose.
Prepare ./compose.yml and caddy/Dockerfile, and start Caddy as a Docker container.
Also, explain how to verify that it is working.
If the files are already prepared, use the existing ones.

Currently, `curl https://my-pc.local/` raises an SSL certificate error.
Fix this issue so that the command works without errors.
The error message is as follows:

```
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
More details here: https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html

curl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not
establish a secure connection to it. To learn more about this situation and
how to fix it, please visit the web page mentioned above.
```
